# Azure Automation Monorepo

This repository serves as the centralized workspace for managing all components of the Azure-based project. It groups together multiple related repositories — including frontend, backend, infrastructure, and Kubernetes configurations — to streamline local development, deployment coordination, and automation tasks.

---

## Contents

- **angular-front/** — Frontend application repository
- **spring-backend/** — Backend API repository
- **terraform-infra/** — Infrastructure provisioning with Terraform
- **k8s/** — Kubernetes manifests and configurations

---

## Purpose

The monorepo structure simplifies dependency management and development workflows by consolidating all project parts into a single repository. This facilitates coordinated changes across services and infrastructure while maintaining separation of concerns through subdirectories.
